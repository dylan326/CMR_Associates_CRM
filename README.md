# CMR_Associates_CRM
Customer Relationship Management System

This CRM was build for CMR & Associates.  It is coded a bit sloppy as I was asked to do this quickly.
However, It has a lot of functionality and has really helped the team manage their clients.  Some features
include a personalized follow-up section, hot lead functionality,  a log call section and batch gathering to name a few.
Since it was thrown together rather quick I try to go back time to time and fix it when I get time.


NOTE: The URL is resumedylanoldham.com because the free domain we were useing stopped working and my boss is in london.  Had to use a domain I own for the time being.  It will be changed soon.
